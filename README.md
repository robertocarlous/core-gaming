# 🎮 Core Gaming - Russian Roulette

**Core Gaming - Russian Roulette** is a decentralized web application where users participate in a high-stakes elimination game built on **Core Testnet**.  

Players stake tokens to join a game room, and one by one, they are eliminated through a randomized process until only one player remains — who claims the entire prize pool.  

The game logic is powered by a smart contract deployed to Core Testnet, ensuring **transparency, fairness, and tamper-proof gameplay**.

## 🚀 Features

- **Game Creation**  
  A player initiates a new game room, specifying the stake amount required to join. The creator automatically deposits the stake when creating the room.

- **Multi-Player Support**  
  Up to **5 players** (creator + 4 others) can join a game room by sending the required stake amount.

- **Game Start**  
  Once 5 players have joined, anyone can trigger the game to start. All staked tokens are held securely by the smart contract.

- **Russian Roulette Rounds**  
  Each round, the roulette is spun to randomly eliminate one player using `block.prevrandao`.  
  The process repeats until only one winner remains.

- **Winner Takes All**  
  The final player standing wins the entire prize pool (all 5 players' stakes combined).
